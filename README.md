# GCMD ‚Äî The Future of Human-Computer Interaction

> Control your computer with gestures. No keyboard. No mouse. Just motion.

## What Is GCMD?

GCMD is a **gesture-based UI navigation system** that turns your webcam into a powerful spatial interface.  
Think **Raycast**, but for your hands.

Navigate, control, and command your desktop environment using nothing but **natural hand movements** ‚Äî in the air, in real-time, with **depth-aware precision**.

---

## Why GCMD?

We built GCMD to challenge the status quo of human-computer interaction.

While most systems today rely on clicks, taps, or voice ‚Äî GCMD introduces a new layer: **spatial interaction**.

This isn‚Äôt just a tool for accessibility.  
This is a **productivity upgrade** ‚Äî for creators, developers, artists, power users, and visionaries who want to:

- Navigate faster
- Trigger commands with gestures
- Move objects across 3D space
- Control apps, windows, media, and more ‚Äî with _air-touch_

---

## How It Works

- Uses your **built-in camera** (e.g., MacBook‚Äôs FaceTime)
- Tracks hand gestures using **MediaPipe + Tensorflow.js**
- Projects your hand into a **3D interactive field** on your screen
- Interprets gestures as **UI commands**: scroll, click, swipe, zoom, etc.
- Includes a **depth-based z-axis** using **motion parallax** for realistic 3D control

> The closer you move your hand to the camera, the deeper you reach into your screen.

## The Vision

GCMD is more than a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **new standard**.

We are building toward a future where:

- Your **hands appear inside your screen** with spatial awareness
- You can **pinch windows to close**, **swipe to switch apps**, and **grab 3D objects**
- You interact with your computer like it's an extension of your body
- Every movement, from the twitch of a finger to a sweeping gesture, is **fluid, intuitive, and productive**

We're leveraging the best of **3D web tech (Three.js)** and **gesture AI (MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js)** to craft a **natural, immersive interface**.

---

## What's Next

In upcoming versions, GCMD will introduce:

- Object manipulation in 3D space
- Depth-aware UI layers & motion parallax
- Seamless voice+gesture hybrid commands
- Plug-and-play macOS integration (native `.dmg` installer)
- Full gesture-to-shortcut mapping for power users

## üßç Who Is It For?

- Designers & Developers
- Creatives & Streamers
- Productivity Hackers
- Accessibility Advocates
- Curious Humans & Tech Enthusiasts

GCMD is for **everyone who wants to do more, with less**.

## What Is GCMD?

GCMD is a **gesture-based UI navigation system** that turns your webcam into a powerful spatial interface.  
Think **Raycast**, but for your hands.

Navigate, control, and command your desktop environment using nothing but **natural hand movements** ‚Äî in the air, in real-time, with **depth-aware precision**.

### üéØ **NEW: Enhanced 3D Hand Tracking System**

Our latest release introduces revolutionary hand tracking capabilities:

- **üéÆ 3D Laser Pointer System**: Infinite laser beam that extends from your hand to a distant wall
- **üéØ Aim & Background Control**: Precise cursor control with magnetic snapping to center
- **üî´ Point & Shoot Gaming**: Gun mechanics with realistic aiming and shooting
- **üöó Car Driving Simulation**: Vehicle control using hand gestures
- **‚öôÔ∏è Calibration System**: Adjustable sensitivity and hand range for perfect control
- **üñ±Ô∏è Real Mouse Control**: Actual mouse events sent to browser for game integration
- **‚ú® Zero Jitter Movement**: Ultra-smooth cursor with 0.99 smoothing factor

### üéÆ **Interactive Modes**

1. **üéØ Aim & Background**:

   - Hand stays centered horizontally
   - Vertical movement controls aiming
   - Calibrated Y-axis sensitivity
   - Strong magnetic snapping to center
   - Infinite yellow laser pointer

2. **üî´ Point & Shoot**:

   - Gun barrel from wrist to knuckle
   - Laser follows actual pointing direction
   - Full fist = Shoot
   - Realistic 3D physics simulation
   - Target hit detection and explosions

3. **üöó Car Driving**:

   - Hand gestures control vehicle
   - Steering, acceleration, braking
   - Real-time physics simulation
   - Immersive driving experience

4. **üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Test**:
   - Real mouse cursor control
   - Works with any web app/game
   - Browser integration ready

## Why GCMD?

We built GCMD to challenge the status quo of human-computer interaction.

While most systems today rely on clicks, taps, or voice ‚Äî GCMD introduces a new layer: **spatial interaction**.

This isn‚Äôt just a tool for accessibility.  
This is a **productivity upgrade** ‚Äî for creators, developers, artists, power users, and visionaries who want to:

- Navigate faster
- Trigger commands with gestures
- Move objects across 3D space
- Control apps, windows, media, and more ‚Äî with _air-touch_

---

## How It Works

- Uses your **built-in camera** (e.g., MacBook's FaceTime)
- Tracks hand gestures using **MediaPipe + Tensorflow.js**
- Projects your hand into a **3D interactive field** on your screen
- Interprets gestures as **UI commands**: scroll, click, swipe, zoom, etc.
- Includes a **depth-based z-axis** using **motion parallax** for realistic 3D control
- **NEW**: 3D laser pointer system with infinite beam projection
- **NEW**: Calibrated aiming with magnetic snapping and zero jitter
- **NEW**: Real mouse event simulation for browser game integration

### üéØ **Advanced Hand Tracking Features**

- **Infinite Laser Pointer**: 10-meter laser beam from hand to distant wall
- **Precise Aiming**: Calibrated Y-axis sensitivity with adjustable hand range
- **Magnetic Snapping**: Automatic center attraction with smooth return
- **Zero Jitter**: Ultra-smooth cursor movement with 0.99 smoothing factor
- **Real Mouse Control**: Actual `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup` events
- **3D Physics**: Realistic intersection calculations and depth perception
- **Gesture Recognition**: Pointing, shooting, dragging, and driving gestures

> The closer you move your hand to the camera, the deeper you reach into your screen.  
> **NEW**: Point your hand to aim, make a fist to shoot, extend fingers to drag.

## The Vision

GCMD is more than a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **new standard**.

We are building toward a future where:

- Your **hands appear inside your screen** with spatial awareness
- You can **pinch windows to close**, **swipe to switch apps**, and **grab 3D objects**
- You interact with your computer like it's an extension of your body
- Every movement, from the twitch of a finger to a sweeping gesture, is **fluid, intuitive, and productive**

We're leveraging the best of **3D web tech (Three.js)** and **gesture AI (MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js)** to craft a **natural, immersive interface**.
